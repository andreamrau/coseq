Description: Co-expression analysis for expression profiles arising from
        high-throughput sequencing data. Feature (e.g., gene) profiles 
		are clustered using adapted transformations and mixture models or 
		a K-means algorithm, and model selection criteria
        (to choose an appropriate number of clusters) are provided.
